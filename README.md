2018 Data Science Bowl: Find the nuclei in divergent images to advance medical discovery

Spot Nuclei. Speed Cures.
Imagine speeding up research for almost every disease, from lung cancer and heart disease to rare disorders. The 2018 Data Science Bowl offers our most ambitious mission yet: create an algorithm to automate nucleus detection.


Why nuclei?
Identifying the cells’ nuclei is the starting point for most analyses because most of the human body’s 30 trillion cells contain a nucleus full of DNA, the genetic code that programs each cell. Identifying nuclei allows researchers to identify each individual cell in a sample, and by measuring how cells react to various treatments, the researcher can understand the underlying biological processes at work.
